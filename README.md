Text Classification with TensorFlow based on BERT architecture
![alt text](https://github.com/sajedehfzh/Text-Classification-with-TensorFlow/blob/main/tokenizedGraph..jpg)
project on fine-tuning a Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) model for text classification with TensorFlow ,  preprocess and tokenize data for BERT classification, build TensorFlow input pipelines for text data with the tf.data API, and train and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub.
Our data is used for fit model is "Quora Insincere Questions Dataset"
